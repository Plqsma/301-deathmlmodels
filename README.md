# 375-deathmlmodels
Analyzing leading causes of death in NYC using machine learning and regression models to uncover patterns across demographic groups.

This project analyzes the leading causes of death in New York City using public health data. By applying data preprocessing, visualization, and multiple regression models, the project aims to uncover patterns and demographic correlations (e.g., by ethnicity, sex, and year) to predict death rates from causes such as Alzheimer's and heart disease.

Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
- Jupyter Notebook

Process:
Cleaned and encoded categorical variables in a health dataset
Visualized demographic and temporal trends using heatmaps and bar charts
Trained regression models to predict death rate and age-adjusted death rate
Evaluated model performance using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Conclusion:
Certain racial/ethnic groups were disproportionately affected by specific causes (e.g., Alzheimer's in non-Hispanic whites)
Regression models showed moderate predictive ability using limited features
Highlighted the need for more granular and complete health data for improved accuracy
